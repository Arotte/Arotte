🔬 As an AI researcher, I am enthusiastic about making LLM-based dialogue agents more human-like. To do so, I employ interpretability techniques and phenomena from psycholinguistics to uncover what makes language models tick in dialogue settings, then use these findings to propose potential vectors of improvement.

⚙️ As a research engineer in Cambridge, I craft and train custom LLMs and LLM-based tools for the legal industry.
